        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          We started this journey with a simple vision: to create a welcoming space for everyone interested in web development. 
          Our website was built with passion and dedication, combining the power of Node.js with the simplicity of HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we've grown from a small project to a comprehensive resource for learning and building amazing web applications.
